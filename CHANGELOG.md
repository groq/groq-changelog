  }'
```

### [CHANGED] Python SDK v0.31.0, TypeScript SDK v0.30.0

The Python SDK has been updated to v0.30.0 and the Typescript SDK has been updated to v0.27.0.

**Key Changes:**
 - Added support for `high`, `medium`, and `low` options for `reasoning_effort` when using GPT-OSS models to control their reasoning output. [Learn more about how to use these options to control reasoning tokens.](https://console.groq.com/docs/reasoning#reasoning-effort)
 - Added support for [`browser_search`](https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-search) and [`code_interpreter`](https://console.groq.com/docs/code-execution) as function/tool definition types in the `tools` array in a chat completion request. Specify one or both of these as tools to allow GPT-OSS models to automatically call them on the server side when needed.
 - Added an optional `include_reasoning` boolean option to chat completion requests to allow configuring if the model returns a response in a `reasoning` field or not. This option is not supported for GPT-OSS models.

## 2025-07-18 (Python SDK v0.30.0, TypeScript SDK v0.27.0)

### [ADDED] Structured Outputs

Groq now supports [structured outputs](https://console.groq.com/docs/structured-outputs) with JSON schema output for the following models: 
 - [`moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct`](https://console.groq.com/docs/model/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct)
 - [`meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`](https://console.groq.com/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct)
 - [`meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`](https://console.groq.com/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct)
 
This feature guarantees your model responses strictly conform to your provided [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), ensuring reliable data structures without missing fields or invalid values. Structured outputs eliminate the need for complex parsing logic and reduce errors from malformed JSON responses.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Guaranteed Compliance**: Responses always match your exact schema specifications
- **Type Safety**: Eliminates parsing errors and unexpected data types
- **Developer Experience**: No need to prompt engineer for format adherence

```

## 2025-05-08 (Python SDK v0.24.0, TypeScript SDK v0.21.0)

### [ADDED] Compound Beta Search Settings

Groq's Compound Beta and Compound Beta Mini agentic tool systems now support domain-based search filtering through two new parameters: `exclude_domains` and `include_domains`. 

 - `exclude_domains` allows you to specify domains that should be omitted from web search results.
 - `include_domains` lets you limit web searches to only return results from specified domains.

Example usage to exclude Wikipedia from searches:

```sh
curl "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${GROQ_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{
         "messages": [
           {
             "role": "user",
             "content": "Tell me about the history of Bonsai trees in America"
           }
         ],
         "model": "compound-beta-mini",
         "exclude_domains": ["wikipedia.org"]
       }'
```

[Learn more about search settings in our docs](https://console.groq.com/docs/agentic-tooling#search-settings), including [advanced usage with domain wildcards](https://console.groq.com/docs/agentic-tooling#domain-filtering-with-wildcards).

### [CHANGED] Python SDK v0.24.0, TypeScript SDK v0.21.0

The Python SDK has been updated to v0.24.0 and the Typescript SDK has been updated to v0.21.0.

**Key Changes:**
 - Added support for domain filtering in Compound Beta [search settings](https://console.groq.com/docs/agentic-tooling#search-settings). Use `include_domains` to restrict searches to specific domains, or `exclude_domains` to omit results from certain domains when using [`compound-beta`](https://console.groq.com/docs/agentic-tooling/compound-beta) or [`compound-beta-mini`](https://console.groq.com/docs/agentic-tooling/compound-beta-mini) models.

## 2025-04-23 (Python SDK v0.23.0, TypeScript SDK v0.20.0)

### [CHANGED] Python SDK v0.23.0, TypeScript SDK v0.20.0

The Python SDK has been updated to v0.23.0 and the Typescript SDK has been updated to v0.20.0.

**Key Changes:**

 - `groq.files.content` returns a `Response` object now to allow parsing as text (for `jsonl` files) or blob for generic file types. Previously, the return type as a JSON object was incorrect, and this caused the SDK to encounter an error instead of returning the file's contents. Example usage in Typescript:

```ts
const response = await groq.files.content("file_XXXX");
const file_text = await response.text();
```

 - `BatchCreateParams` now accepts a `string` as input to `completion_window` to allow for durations between `24h` and `7d`. Using a longer completion window gives your batch job a greater chance of completing successfully without timing out. For larger batch requests, it's recommended to split them up into multiple batch jobs. [Learn more about best practices for batch processing](https://console.groq.com/docs/batch).
 - Updated chat completion `model` parameter to remove deprecated models and add newer production models.
   - Removed: `gemma-7b-it` and `mixtral-8x7b-32768`.
   - Added: `gemma2-9b-it`, `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, and `llama-guard-3-8b`.
   - For the most up-to-date information on Groq's models, see the [models page](https://console.groq.com/docs/models), or learn more about our [deprecations policy](https://console.groq.com/docs/deprecations).
 - Added optional chat completion `metadata` parameter for better compatibility with OpenAI chat completion API. [Learn more about switching from OpenAI to Groq](https://console.groq.com/docs/openai).
